# Prison-Break-Attempted-Helicopter-Escapes

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to web scrape a Wikipedia article on attempted helicopter escapes from prison. Once the data has been extracted from the web page, 2 questions will sought to be answered:

* In which year did the most attempts at breaking out of prison with a helicopter occur?

* In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison escapes occur?

## Opening and Exploring the Data

In order to scrape the data from the web page and create appropriate functions for manipulating it, several libraries will need to be imported:

* import `pandas` as `pd`<br>
* import `re`<br>
* import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`<br>
* from `IPython.core.display` import `display`, `HTML`<br>


## Usage

The dataset will be explored using Jupyter Notebook. To run the project you will want to install Jupyter Notebook. The easiest way to do this is by installing Anaconda Navigator. This link will direct you on how to install for your appropriate operating system: Windows, Mac OS, Linux, etc. Once installed, you should have access to several applications, one of them being Jupyter Notebook.
